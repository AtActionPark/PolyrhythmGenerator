Test for generating drum polyrhythms.

Parameters are:

* Tempo
* Time Signature
* Max length (desired maximum length in step of the output. Not taken into account if not possible)
* Notes density
* Number of Rhythms 
* Use left foot
* Orchestrate 
* Euclidean (use euclidean rhythm - bjorklund algo - to produce evenly distributed patterns)

And a way to force specific length for each limb. 

Each combination produces a seed that cam be loaded or inputed in the url for saving/sharing.

Would appreciate any input
